The driver pass company was created to aide people whom do not have their license to pass their driving tests. It did this by proving a variety of resources. These included online tests and lessons with a driving instructor. The client was the driver pass company and they wanted to build a web based system that would help them accomplish the previously stated goal. It would allow a user of the system to log in, and take practice tests, view the DMV handbook as well as set up driving reservations. 

The company did not want to deal with the intricacies and maintenance and other complications that arise when one owns in house servers. Instead they opted to use a cloud based platform to run their web system. The system will have different users including students, driving instructors, it administrators, the CEO as well as the companies secretary. 

I believe I did a good job when it came to implementing the UML diagrams. I had made one that detailed the login process as well as the process that takes place when one sets up a driving appointment.

I personally do not believe my use case diagram was the most optimal/organized. If I was to redo this project that would be on aspect I would work on. I would make it more organized and clean the lines up.

The user is the backbone of the system. If they do not like it they will stop using it. And this will lead to the demise of the system. So users needs always have to be accounted for. When it came to driver pass we had to make sure that the login times were quick. A slow, bogged down system would cause users to leave so this was a big focus of ours.

The business requirement diagram was a detailed template that organized the requirements into multiple different sections. This essentially breaks the problem down and makes it easier to comprehend. I would use something similar to this diagram if I was creating some sort of system. Listing the functional and non functional requirements from the get-go is important and will provide direction when it comes to tackling a project.
